# Line-Spacing-Application
##  Intended Use:  
When folding origami, the first step is often to create a set of creases, which are then used to collapse the model before shaping into the final form. This first step (precreasing) is tedious and time consuming, but could potentially be automated by using a laser cutter to score the paper. Unfortunately, doing this often leaves holes in the paper where the lines intersect (and the laser subsequently passes over multiple times). In order to mitigate this problem, this program slightly shortens each line so that they don't intersect. This prevents holes from forming in the paper without affecting the collapse. This program accepts CP files, which is the default file type for storing crease patterns, converts it to a PNG file, and then handles the line intersections.

##  Instructions For Use:
**In order to use the default action, you must set an appropriate file path**

The first step is to open the crease pattern with the "Open CP" button. From there, the "+" button will increase the gaps between line intersections, and the "-" does the reverse. "Default Save" will save the file to a pre-specified location. "Default Action" does a pre programmed action, mainly used for debugging purposes.
